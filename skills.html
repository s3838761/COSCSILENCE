           <h1>Skills and Jobs</h1>
            <p>Application Programmer – The application programmer is one of the necessary positions that is required for this project. The application programmer would be in charge of programming the application, ensuring that each function performs properly and at the correct time. Having a skilled programmer that has skills in programming languages such as JavaScript, C++ and other languages targeted for mobile applications would ensure that the app would run correctly and efficiently without crashing. Ideally the application programmer would have completed a course in tertiary education in the IT field, such as the bachelor of IT or Computer Science. The Application programmer would have to work with both the UI developer and the sound designer to ensure that both the interface and the sound is implemented in the correct areas and works as intended within the app.</p>
            <p>UI developer – The UI developer is one of the more important positions for this project as the app is intended for a younger audience, the interface will be important to ensure that the children that are using the app are not bored and are visually stimulated throughout the app as children are often visual learners and require the appropriate colours and images to be entertained and continue using the app. Having a sleek, colourful design will allow for the purpose of the app to be attained, and therefore allowing dopamine to be created in the child’s brain. The UI designer should be creative and also knowledgeable about children. The UI designer should also be skilled in image editing software and diagramming programs such as Adobe Photoshop and Figma. The UI designer would work together with the application programmer to ensure that the interface is implemented correctly.</p>
            <p>Sound Designer – The Sound Designer is another one of the important positions required for the project, similar to the UI developer sound is very important for entertaining the younger audience and ensuring that they get their dopamine. The sound designer would also need to be knowledgeable about children and innovative in the choice of sounds being used. Having the correct sounds at the correct times would allow for dopamine to be created in the children and allow for the app to be successful. The sound designer is required to have knowledge of making sound effects and programs such as Sound Effect Maker for Windows to create the required sounds. The sound designer would work closely with the application programmer and the UI developer, with sound being implemented at certain prompts and with certain images being popped up with that sound. An example of this could be when tickets are rewarded, a popup would show up and a sound would be played.</p>
            <p>Tester – The tester is a required role for the project and is important for ensuring that the app can run correctly and without crashing. The tester would need to go through the user flow diagram within the app, while being able to notice any errors or if there are any improvements that could be made. While the tester does not need any specific skills, it would be good if the tester is knowledgeable about all of the previous roles and their fields. Having the knowledge about all of them will allow for the tester to find errors and possible improvements for each of the fields. The tester would need good communication skills and leadership skills to both direct the team and also communicate what needs to be changed or what needs to be fixed.</p>
