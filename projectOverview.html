            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <h2>Topic</h2>
            <p>For this project, team Silence has proposed to develop a motivational checklist application that is specifically designed for children to assist them in achieving the main outcome of the app which is to optimise productivity efficiently and effortlessly in such a way that it’s enjoyable and fun for the users (children), this can consequently result in the promotion and reinforcement of other beneficial habits such as time and resource management, meeting deadlines, organisation skills, decision makings etc. 
            <br>The project’s effectiveness and functionality revolves around the fundamental factors of Dopamine and the process of gamification. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter in our brain that is responsible for the coordination of our movements, memory, learning and any behaviours that are associated with rewarding and pleasurable sensations. The release of dopamine can be triggered by many things and one of them is progression, since a to-do list essentially reinforces the idea of progress, the act of ticking an item off the list is rewarding in itself. The concept of gamification is also essential as it helps to make the application and overall experience more engaging and entertaining by integrating game elements into the application, for example, a scoring system to provide a visual aid of progress. These components are critical for our project because they both collectively work to provide a source of motivation for users.</p>

            <h2>Motivation </h2>
            <p>The driving motivation behind this project idea is that I (Dat) myself sometimes find it difficult to complete certain tasks under an appropriate time span and always find myself distracted by the smallest things surrounding my environment, I also spend a majority of my work time procrastinating, figuring out the philosophy of life or getting stuck in an infinite thought loop. The effect of procrastination is even further amplified given our current situation with the whole lockdown and remote learning business and this only happens whenever I do work/school related tasks or even just tasks that I find generally boring, but when it comes to other things such as watching a movie, gaming, playing a sport or just any other entertainment related tasks, my efficiency levels suddenly skyrocket. And that’s when the concept of gamification came to my mind. In brief, gamification is the process of incorporating the elements and features of a game into something that already exists in order to generally gain better results as people are familiar and naturally drawn to the idea of obtaining rewards and praises for an action, but the difference is that this time they’ll gain a real-life achievement rather than just a false sense of it.
            <br>The completion of this project will show future employers that we as a team are able to come together and utilise each of our own skills and specialties to create a tangible prototype of our application. We started this project with nothing but an idea and a brief overview of the app’s functionalities and features and were able to move it through multiple phases of research, planning, prototyping and finally (assuming that we’ve been given extra time and resource) development.</p>

            <h2>Landscape</h2>
            <p>Currently there are numerous other applications out there with the same idea/concept, in that most if not all of them focus on maximising productivity, but their forms of execution differ vastly from each other. The most noticeable trend amongst all the ‘motivational to do list’ applications on the market is that most applications are either heavily game based or focused on adding intuitive features to a standard to do list, this is possibly due to the age of targeted consumer/user for the various apps, this contrast can be portrayed through the difference between ‘EpicWin’ and ‘Microsoft To Do’. ‘EpicWin’ is a RGP based to do list app where the assigned tasks are quests that can be completed through a combat system and users can gain in-game progression and rewards by completing these tasks under a specified timeline, on the other hand, ‘Microsoft To Do’ is just your average to do list app but the distinct feature here is that the application is heavily integrated into the microsoft ecosystem, allowing for cloud access and sync across multiple devices on the same account with the addition of microsoft’s virtual assistant. Dopamine’s differentiating factor from its competitors is that our application of the gamification concept is a bit more low-key yet still a little bit intriguing to keep users engaged, an example of this is the scoring and rewarding feature of Dopa-Mine as it incorporates in game achievements with real life rewarding elements allowing for users to keep/save up their in-game currencies and spend it on other assigned rewards.</p>
