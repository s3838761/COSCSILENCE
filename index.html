                    <p>My name is Dat Vo (s3901237) and I am a first year student at RMIT currently attending the Bachelor of I.T course. I was born and raised in Vietnam for the past 12 years and moved to Melbourne back in early 2015 where I continued and finished my secondary education. Ethnically, I’m half Vietnamese, half Chinese and I am able to speak fluently in both dialects. Some of my hobbies include skateboarding, consuming copious amounts of anime and pestering my cat with hugs and kisses. I basically have little to no experience when it comes to all I.T related things, though it has always captivated my curiosities and yearnings to learn more about how certain things work in the way they do, specifically the aspects of the internet/networking and the idea of “staying connected”. My interest in this particular field of IT stemmed from all those video calls and text messages I’d often send to my relatives back in the motherland when we first arrived in Australia. I remembered being perplexed by the idea that I am currently talking to and seeing a live feed of someone from another continent in real time. Ever since then, I’ve always pondered how we went from a rock and a couple of sticks to some dark sorcery high-tech 4D mirroring contraption able to teleport you into a virtual platform where you can do anything you wish as long as it’s not illegal and you have an internet connection.</p>

                    <p>My name is Benjamin Bilotta, and I am a first year Bachelor of Information Technology. I am from a Uruguayan family and am quite passionate about the IT industry. I spend the majority of my past time on computers or various game consoles, playing games, messing around on photoshop, or watching various YouTube videos. When it comes down to my IT experience, I have a certificate 3 in screen and media and completed my first year of computer science at RMIT before changing programs. As part of completing my certificate 3 in screen and media I built a couple websites, and this is where my passion for web development and front-end development was discovered. When it comes to hobbies unrelated to IT, it mainly involves skateboarding, listening to music and watching various anime or reading their manga.</p>

                    <p>My name is Budoor Alsaleem.  I am a first year Bachelor of Information Technology student at RMIT University. I am from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia where I lived, studied, and got married. In 2019, my husband and I moved to Australia to study English and complete our bachelor's degrees. Since I was young, I have liked to watch and listen to the latest technology news and innovations; however, my real interest in technology started when I have been inspired by the passion and love of my father-in-law in technology, especially information security, as he works in a high and important technical position in the Saudi government. He said to me once, "Technology is originally a beautiful thing that helped human in all areas of life, such as education, medicine, industry, etc., but some people made it something scary, dangerous and bad, and it is our duty to protect the beauty of technology from these people.", therefore, I decided to study information technology to understand the bigger picture of technology and then I would like to specialize in cybersecurity or information security in  in order to help and contribute to the continuation of technology as an enabler and facilitator of human life, and not the other way around. As for my hobbies, I like to make and watch complex beautiful hair styles, jogging, reading, and listening to audio podcasts interested in technology and beauty.</p>

                    <p>Hi! My name is Richard Lim, 18 years old and a 2020 Highschool Graduate. Currently I am a student at RMIT for the Bachelor of Information Technology degree. Both of my parents came from Cambodia, making me a Cambodian Australian. They ended up immigrating to Australia, Victoria as refugees and have been living here ever since. I have two older brothers, and we were all born and raised in Australia. My main hobby is to play video games, having hundreds of hours in both DOTA2 and CS:GO, and having my current favourite games of Tekken 7 and Valorant.</p>

My bloodline is half Vietnamese and half Chinese except my main ethnicity is Vietnamese. I speak English and Vietnamese and a speck of words in Teochew which is a Southern Chinese dialect. I have had multiple interests in the past. I was into dancing during my primary years and performed at Crown under Jason’s Ministry of Dance. High school years I devoted my time and energy into martial arts, specifically taekwondo. I competed in local and state competitions and my club would perform in Lunar New Year Festivals. I have zero interest in Information Technology. My field of knowledge in Information technology currently consists of basic HTML and CSS formatting.</p>

            <h1>Tools</h1>
            <p>To complete this assignment our group used various tools/software. The various tools we used are as follow:</p>
            <ul class="dash">
                <li>Microsoft Teams</li>
                <ul class="circle">
                    <li>Microsoft teams was as the main hub of group communication. All meetings were held in Microsoft teams and even the interview was conducted on Microsoft teams. Furthermore, links or files that needed to be shared amongst the whole team was shared here. These links include but not limited to the GitHub repository link and the Google doc’s link.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>GitHub</li>
                <ul class="circle">
                    <li>GitHub was mainly used to share the website amongst the team members and have it so that all members can work on it at any given time. As well as this the repository was used to host GitHub pages to view the website as a whole.</li>
                </ul>
	            <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
                <ul class="circle">
                    <li>Visual Studio Code was used code the entire website with all the HTML and CSS. </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Google Docs</li>
                <ul class="circle">
                    <li>The team used Google Doc’s as a hub to collect all written content while also being able to edit and add content simultaneously.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
                <ul class="circle">
                    <li>Adobe Photoshop was briefly used to edit images that would be used on the website.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>Using all these tools we as a team have investigated 4 IT technologies. These IT technologies we decided to investigate were Robots, Autonomous Vehicles, Clouds Services and Servers and Cybersecurity. As well as this the team was able to conduct an interview on an IT profession which gave us a valuable insight on life as someone working in the IT field. Following on from this we also analyzed industry data on IT jobs and compared it with all our ideal jobs. Furthermore, we were able to come up with a solid project idea which would be developed in Assignment 3. </p>
