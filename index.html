                    <p>My name is Dat Vo (s3901237) and I am a first year student at RMIT currently attending the Bachelor of I.T course. I was born and raised in Vietnam for the past 12 years and moved to Melbourne back in early 2015 where I continued and finished my secondary education. Ethnically, I’m half Vietnamese, half Chinese and I am able to speak fluently in both dialects. Some of my hobbies include skateboarding, consuming copious amounts of anime and pestering my cat with hugs and kisses. I basically have little to no experience when it comes to all I.T related things, though it has always captivated my curiosities and yearnings to learn more about how certain things work in the way they do, specifically the aspects of the internet/networking and the idea of “staying connected”. My interest in this particular field of IT stemmed from all those video calls and text messages I’d often send to my relatives back in the motherland when we first arrived in Australia. I remembered being perplexed by the idea that I am currently talking to and seeing a live feed of someone from another continent in real time. Ever since then, I’ve always pondered how we went from a rock and a couple of sticks to some dark sorcery high-tech 4D mirroring contraption able to teleport you into a virtual platform where you can do anything you wish as long as it’s not illegal and you have an internet connection.</p>

                    <p>My name is Benjamin Bilotta, and I am a first year Bachelor of Information Technology. I am from a Uruguayan family and am quite passionate about the IT industry. I spend the majority of my past time on computers or various game consoles, playing games, messing around on photoshop, or watching various YouTube videos. When it comes down to my IT experience, I have a certificate 3 in screen and media and completed my first year of computer science at RMIT before changing programs. As part of completing my certificate 3 in screen and media I built a couple websites, and this is where my passion for web development and front-end development was discovered. When it comes to hobbies unrelated to IT, it mainly involves skateboarding, listening to music and watching various anime or reading their manga.</p>

                    <p>My name is Budoor Alsaleem.  I am a first year Bachelor of Information Technology student at RMIT University. I am from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia where I lived, studied, and got married. In 2019, my husband and I moved to Australia to study English and complete our bachelor's degrees. Since I was young, I have liked to watch and listen to the latest technology news and innovations; however, my real interest in technology started when I have been inspired by the passion and love of my father-in-law in technology, especially information security, as he works in a high and important technical position in the Saudi government. He said to me once, "Technology is originally a beautiful thing that helped human in all areas of life, such as education, medicine, industry, etc., but some people made it something scary, dangerous and bad, and it is our duty to protect the beauty of technology from these people.", therefore, I decided to study information technology to understand the bigger picture of technology and then I would like to specialize in cybersecurity or information security in  in order to help and contribute to the continuation of technology as an enabler and facilitator of human life, and not the other way around. As for my hobbies, I like to make and watch complex beautiful hair styles, jogging, reading, and listening to audio podcasts interested in technology and beauty.</p>

                    <p>Hi! My name is Richard Lim, 18 years old and a 2020 Highschool Graduate. Currently I am a student at RMIT for the Bachelor of Information Technology degree. Both of my parents came from Cambodia, making me a Cambodian Australian. They ended up immigrating to Australia, Victoria as refugees and have been living here ever since. I have two older brothers, and we were all born and raised in Australia. My main hobby is to play video games, having hundreds of hours in both DOTA2 and CS:GO, and having my current favourite games of Tekken 7 and Valorant.</p>

My bloodline is half Vietnamese and half Chinese except my main ethnicity is Vietnamese. I speak English and Vietnamese and a speck of words in Teochew which is a Southern Chinese dialect. I have had multiple interests in the past. I was into dancing during my primary years and performed at Crown under Jason’s Ministry of Dance. High school years I devoted my time and energy into martial arts, specifically taekwondo. I competed in local and state competitions and my club would perform in Lunar New Year Festivals. I have zero interest in Information Technology. My field of knowledge in Information technology currently consists of basic HTML and CSS formatting.</p>

            <h1>Group Processes</h1>
            <p>Based on assignment 2 many things could be improved upon. The main area of failure we experienced was with a lack of communication which resulted in members taking on more work than others and little to no work being done by others. This isn’t just a communication problem but also a commitment and dedication issue. The first way we plan on tackling this and improving this is by having more meetings a week with a set time that everyone in the group is aware of.
                <br>We also discussed that everyone should be checking the team's chat at least once a day. This would help to ensure that everyone is up to date with the latest information. On top of this a new feature in Microsoft Teams was introduced with a plugin that allows for members to assign roles for them to complete and mark off once they complete them. This allows for everyone to see what is being worked on, hasn’t been done and what has been completed.
                </p>
                <p>Overall, the team has decided that in order to complete this assignment successfully a major improvement on group communication and collaboration will need to be made.</p>

            <h1>Tools</h1>
            <p>In this assignment our group has been able to successfully produce 3 artifacts 2 of which being a prototype. We have included a flow diagram to illustrate proper navigation of the app and the different paths a user can take when using our app. It also is there to help illustrate how each component of the app will work together using various techniques like asking for user input, radio buttons, drop down menus and buttons in general. As well as this we have provided a Figma prototype which acts to show the user interface of the app and further illustrate the navigation. This has also been used to help with the 2nd prototype that was developed with Flutter. Our flutter prototype doesn’t focus too much on the user interface but reflects some functionality that the app when fully produced will contain. The functionality that we wished to flesh out in this prototype are the random task being selected, and the various interactive elements such as buttons and check lists.

                <br>On top of this visual studio code was used to edit our previous website which was made in Assignment 2. To save time we simply just replaced the information with that we have, as opposed to creating a new website from scratch.
