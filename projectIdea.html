            <h1>Project Idea</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>For our group’s IT project, we will attempt to develop a motivational mobile app for children that turns everything they do into a game (eg. doing chores, homeworks, exercising, helping out around the house etc). Features that will be integrated into the app include a progression system, earning both in-game and real life rewards, finishing levels and many more (will be further discussed in the description section). This application can also be used to encourage and motivate not only children but also adults to efficiently complete any tasks that need to be done, although the grown ups would most likely use the application as more of an intuitive checklist rather than a video game.</p>
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>The main motivation behind this project idea is that I myself sometimes find it difficult to complete certain tasks under an appropriate timespan and always find myself distracted by the smallest things surrounding my environment, I also spend a majority of my ‘work’ time procrastinating, figuring out the philosophy of life or get stuck in an infinite thought loop. This only happens whenever I do work/school related tasks or even just tasks that I find generally boring, but when it comes to other things such as watching a movie, gaming, playing a sport and any entertainment related tasks, my efficiency levels suddenly skyrockets. And that’s when the concept of gamification came to my mind, in brief, gamification is the process of incorporating the elements and features of a game into something that already exists in order to generally gain better results as people are familiar and naturally drawn to the idea of obtaining rewards and praises for an action, but the difference is that this time they’ll gain a real life achievement rather than just a false sense of it.</p>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p><i>Dopamine</i> is a neurotransmitter in our brain that is responsible for the coordination of our movements, memory, learning and any behaviours that are rewarding and pleasurable or in layman's terms, funny juice in the brain makes us feel happy!
                <br><i>Dopamine</i> also plays a key role in how this app functions, the release of dopamine can be triggered by many things and one of them is progression and since a to-do list essentially reinforces the idea of progress, the act of ticking an item off the list is rewarding in itself.
                <br>This app works sort of the same as any other average to-do list applications, in that you’ll be able to create a checklist of various tasks and basically check them off after completing one. But that’s where the similarities differentiate, instead of just crossing an item off the list and moving on to the next one, we will integrate in an “in game” progression system allowing users to earn rewards after each level (task) they complete. The reward could be some sort of in game-currency which then can be converted into real life currencies such as online coupons,discount codes, extra special promotions or even real dolla billz, but here’s the catch, in order to prevent users from abusing the system by creating checklists and constantly checking all of them off to farm in-game currencies, users will be required an authentication from another party (most likely be parents/guardians) before checking an item off the list. 
                <br>Main essential features that will be expected are:</p>
                <b>Other essential features that will be integrated into the app includes:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Various modes each designed to fit with the users’ needs, for example, a children focused mode where certain settings and features are only accessible by a third party parent/guardian. Another mode would be more catered to grown ups where usability will be increased  by slightly limiting and modifying the theme of the app to create a minimalist aesthetic (function over form)</li>
                    <li>A progress system that can be tracked and compared to others using the application, it also includes distinct levels where reward can either be self assigned or by a third party when a level/task is accomplished </li>
                    <li>A rewards mechanic allowing a third party user to set a reward that can be earned after the completion of a level/task. Different types of rewards can be applied (including the ones listed previously),but another good one would be allowing more screen time on a child’s smart device, </li>
                </ul>
            <p><b>Other essential features that will be integrated into the app includes:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Intuitive game and graphical design to attract a younger based audience</li>
                <li>Allows parents/guardians to set what sort of real life currency users can exchange their in-game ones to (real money, extra time for leisure, hugs and kisses etc.)</li>
                <li>Pleasant and satisfying UI design to attract other types of audience</li>
                <li>A competitive ranking system that rewards players with different ranks based on their efficiency and ability to complete levels/tasks before deadlines.</li>
                <li>Some sort of social media extension that links players/users social media accounts to the app, enabling them to share their progress and score.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
            <p>The equipment (hardware) 	required for this project includes a personal computer/laptop to program/develop the app itself and a smart mobile device for testing and debugging the app to increase usability. Software-wise, there are alot of platforms to choose from when building a mobile application, some of the well known one being Android and Visual Studio, Xcode,Appypie and the list goes on. But through some research, I think Flutter ( will be the best fit for the team as it is more user friendly and has some unique and helpful features such as a built-in phone emulator which could be used to track and testrun the program without needing to export it.</p>
            <h2>Skills Required</h2>
            <p>Assuming that Flutter will be the choice of my developing platform for the app, we will be required to learn and become somewhat proficient with Dart (a programming language tuned for web and mobile application development), this can be done through the horde of online tutorials showing the concepts and basics. Other than that, some other skill sets that we as a group should consider having before proceeding with this project are being able to work well in a team environment, understand and can apply good UI designs, sound designs and the ability to identify and debug an application if needed.</p>
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>When this project reaches its completion, the application will hopefully assist people who struggle to complete daily or long term tasks through providing levels which they can work through, complete and earn rewards just like in a video game and this can motivates them even more as they won’t find the experience mundane and tedious when compared to the conventional ways of doing things which basically tells u to just do it. Aside from motivations, this application can also help children associate things such as doing homework, chores, exercising, eating a well balanced diet, etc. to positive experiences rather than negative</p>
