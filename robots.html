            <h1>Robots</h1>
            <h2>​​What does it do?</h2>
            <h3>The state of the art of Robotics</h3>
            <p>The science of robotics began in the fifteenth century and went through great developments and unprecedented technological leaps in several fields such as industry, agriculture, and others (Jung, Lazaro & Yun 2021). Robots spread widely around the world due to the large increase in production in exchange for the lack of labour, in addition to the desire to reduce operational costs (Jung, Lazaro & Yun 2021). The impressive performance of programmable industrial robots led people to think about the possibility of robots playing an important role in social aspects, and this is what brought the state of the art of robotics which is the social robot (Jung, Lazaro & Yun 2021). A social robot is a robot that is programmed to have the ability to interact socially with humans, such as understanding and responding to facial expressions, speech, natural sounds, and signals, as well as doing human tasks in home or office and have the ability to learn and self-development (Jung, Lazaro & Yun 2021). There are many effective models of social robots, but the most recent is Sophia, which is a social human-like robot made by Hanson Robotics that can interact with humans by identifying different facial expressions and identifying feelings through tone of voice and then reacting back to them with a human-like respond such as facial expressions and changing voice tone to show empathy or excitement (Hanson Robotics 2020).</p>
            <h3>Social robots today</h3>
            <p>Currently, social robots can interact with different family members by saluting them and calling their names as it can distinguish between them by the tone of their voices (Editorial 2021). Moreover, it can teach and play with the children using its audio conversations, HD projector and facial expressions  (Editorial 2021). It also can help with household chores and safety such as cleaning dishes, vacuuming, monitoring the home to maintain safety and also using sensors to monitor temperature and air quality (Editorial 2021).</p>
            <h3>Near future and technological developments of social Robots</h3>
            <p>In the coming years, the social robot will be given more important and sensitive roles than entertainment and household chores, as it will provide care roles, especially health care. This is due to several reasons, including the increased numbers of elderly people who are in dire need of health care services, especially that the number of workers in healthcare cannot cover the need (Bodenhagen et al. 2019). Although there are many concerns about the ethical issues of using robots in a sensitive sector such as health, there are successful and safe attempts for social robots that helped in mobility and medication of elderly with difficulty of Activities of daily living (ADLs) without any potential danger (Bodenhagen et al. 2019). With the continuous development towards enabling robots to develop themselves by means of self-learning in interaction with humans, social robots will have a great value to add to human social life, such as the great value provided by industrial robots in various industries (Jackson 2017).</p>
            <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
            <h3>The potential impact, change and affected people of the development of social robots</h3>
            <p>Social robots will make a lot of potential impacts in different social sectors such as health, and household activities. For example, one of the most important potential effects on the health side is that social robots will improve the general health of elderly people by reducing their chronic diseases through improving their mobility, reminding them of the times of their medications, bringing their medications and reducing their loneliness by entertaining them (Deutsch et al. 2019; Bodenhagen et al. 2019). Another effect of the health aspect is to improve the health outcomes of autistic patients through motor and vocal interaction with them (Bodenhagen et al. 2019). In the household aspects, increasing the productivity of parents by giving them more time to focus on work or study as social robots will be an effective part of the family that performs many household tasks that used to take time from parents such as sweeping the floor, teaching children, throwing garbage and playing with children (Deutsch et al. 2019)</p>
            <h3>Jobs and Social robots</h3>
            <p>The success and spread of social robots will create more technical and social jobs. This is because social robots are programmed on the social life of specific geographical areas, so when they spread to other geographical areas, more programmers from these geographical areas will be needed to be able to program social robots on the languages, values,​​and social habits of these geographical areas (Jackson 2017). In addition, programmers will need social specialists to study and analyze these social requirements, because it is not their specialty area (Jackson 2017). As for jobs, there is already shortage of workers in the fields of health or household chores, so there will be no significant impact on jobs because the need for social robots is due to the lack of labor, not its abundance (Deutsch et al. 2019; Bodenhagen et al. 2019).</p>
            <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
            <h3>The possible effects of social robots in my daily life and the change that it could make.</h3>
            <p>Social robots will help me significantly by doing some of the home chores which is a big part of the numerous tasks that I do daily for my home and study. Moreover, it will help me to remember and organize my daily tasks. As a result, it will relieve my mental stress and will improve my productivity and my focus on study and personal life. My lifestyle will be different as having a social robot in my life will help me in balancing my studies, home chores and my personal life. I will be able to do many things that I would like to do if I have time such as having special time with my husband, practicing my hobbies such as reading or running, and volunteering in my community, all these are difficult in the meantime, but with the help of social robots, it could be possible.</p>
            <h3>The effects of social robots on my family members or friends.</h3>
            <p>Having a social robot in my family will help to organize their life and reduce family tasks and duties, which will give everyone more time to take care of their personal life and practice their hobbies. In terms of health, having a social robot at home will help my grandfather move and take medication regularly, which will improve his health (Deutsch et al. 2019), as the one who is currently caring for him is one of my aunts, and this takes a lot of her time, so the social robot will solve this problem successfully.</p>
            <h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
            <p><i>What does it do?</i>
                <br>The autonomous vehicle is an automobile that can operate without the intervention of a human being. These systems are fully capable of running without direct human supervision in a safe and successful manner. To operate, they make use of “sensors, actuators, complex algorithms, machine learning systems, and processors” to sense their surroundings. These sensors are mounted on specific areas of the vehicle to create an ongoing map of the vehicle's surroundings. In addition to monitoring the position of nearby vehicles, they monitor traffic lights, road signs and pedestrians. Using radar technology, automobiles can locate nearby vehicles and calculate their speeds and directions. Thus far, the most prominent technology in the public market is radar cruise control which maintains a distance from cars in front of the vehicle with no regard for speed. Light detection sensors, or Lidar, use pulses of light to measure distance, identify road edges, and determine lane markings. Despite its similar purpose and operation, this application is more expensive than similar sensors. In addition, Lidar often struggles to be accurate under unfavourable conditions such as rain, snow, and fog.
                <br>In current technology, autonomous vehicles face significant hurdles and become publicly optional. So self-driving is currently an option. In this scenario, the vehicle can operate to a certain extent depending on its environment, but a human must remain present or be ready to take over in order to drive.
                <br>A multitude of reasons account for autonomous vehicles' absence from the public road system. There is still a lot of work to be done in the technology field. A significant obstacle to an accurate environment identification is weather and traffic conditions that impose challenges to the vehicles' sensors. Among these situations are heavy rain, chaotic traffic jams and poor visibility of road signs due to natural and human interference.
                <br>Machine learning uses software and algorithms that process data that comes from its sensors to accurately conclude a safe decision. However, the market has not come to an agreement with suitable algorithms that are accurately tested in all environments. Further research and development are to be applied in order to make autonomous vehicles safe and available for public use.
                <br>The use of machine learning in autonomous vehicles is also a significant factor that uses software and algorithms to accurately analyse data collected from the vehicle’s sensors. There is still a lack of suitable algorithms that are tested in a wide variety of environments, so further research and development are required by the market to bring autonomous vehicles to the public.
                <br>In addition, the inaccurate sensors, machine learning that isn’t up to par, and celebrities involved in accidents with automated vehicles, such as TESLA, heavily affect social acceptance and are many reasons as to why autonomous vehicles are currently not on the open road.</p>
            <p><i>What is the likely impact?</i>
                <br>Having a fully functional, regulated autonomous vehicle on the open road could have a substantial impact on several aspects for the market. For instance, the safety of travelling on the road will be heightened since human errors will be eradicated, which are the main causes for motor vehicle accidents. As a result of fewer car accidents there are also fewer health-related issues and repair costs. Vehicles being able to communicate with one another, hence, traffic efficiency would be enhanced, and traffic jams avoided, thereby significantly improving social wellbeing and morale.
                <br>There are winners and losers in the autonomous vehicle space; those who do not drive have easier access to transportation thanks to autonomous vehicles. Automated delivery vehicles can be employed by businesses. As a result, employees employed by ride-sharing services, trucks, and food delivery businesses have been reduced to nothing and replaced by autonomous vehicles.</p>
            <p><i>How will this affect you?</i>
                <br>The daily commute to work will be shortened in the immediate future due to shorter travel times. However, in the current job environment, jobs are becoming hybrid work-from-home, and the use of autonomous transportation will have only a minor impact. Contrary to popular belief, car enthusiasts will not find the autonomous vehicle market to their liking and will most certainly continue to use their own vehicles. Nevertheless, these individuals can opt to use the autonomous vehicles for work-related purposes only and keep their personal cars shiny with low odometer readings.
                <br>Extracurricular activities will be looked upon. Individuals can now consume alcohol and substances without worrying about safely returning home after the experience, eliminating the need for a designated driver. Visiting grocery stores and visiting family members have never been easier or safer for elderly relatives.</p>
