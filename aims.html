            <h1>Aims</h1>
            <p>The main aim for this project is to construct a mobile application that acts as a motivational checklist geared towards children, enabling them to not only complete but enjoy doing tasks in an efficient manner. This will be achieved through a combination of gamification and incentivisation, and by applying some of the aspects from both concepts into our application, the outcome of this project should be able to offer a satisfying and frictionless experience for the targeted users (children and/or those who wishes to optimise their productivity) which also includes the authenticators (a separate authentication party such as parents/guardians).</p>
            <h2>Goals:</h2>

            <h3>Provide UI Samples
                <br><em>--Aesthetic of the app--</em></h3>
            <p>The design and aesthetic factors play a critical role in the overall functionalities and effectiveness of our application as children are attracted to the sense of familiarity and will most likely be more inclined to use an application if the user interface is simple, user-friendly, and well colour coordinated. Other aesthetic features that should be taken into consideration are:</p>
            <ul class="circle">
                <li><p>Some sort of animation (and if even possible a sound) for certain actions that are to be performed, for example, a satisfying cross animation over the tasks when it’s checked off, bright and bold colours to differentiate completed and non-completed tasks, plays a pleasing sound or tune when an item is checked off the list. </p></li>
                <li><p>Possibly different UIs or themes for when switching between the various modes of the application. A fun and kid-friendly interface for main users and a more minimal and technical interface for authenticators</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Provide a functional Demo
                <br><em>-- Functionalities of the app--</em>
            </h3>
            <p>The essential functionality of the application is to provide users with a customizable checklist (in any format) that is created by the authentication third party. When users have completed a task, they are rewarded with an in app currency in the form of tickets. These tickets can be accumulated over time to be redeemed for real life rewards which are assigned by the parent/guardian. These rewards can be anything from screen time on an iPad, a handful of candy or even some money, the decision is completely up to the parent/guardian to make.
            Other minor functionalities the application demo should illustrate are perhaps:

            //NOT ACHIEVEABLE

            An app wouldn’t be anything if it didn’t function as intended, hence this is why we as a group should prioritise both the functionalities and aesthetic features as a bare minimum requirement for the application.</p>

            <h3>Technical skills</h3>
            <p>In order to achieve the aim and goals of this project, we must take these IT-related technical skills into consideration: 
            <b>Web Development (HTML + CSS):</b> This is for developing the website containing the content of our report. Members should have already familiarized themselves with this skillset back in assignment 1.
            <b>Flutter:</b> Flutter is responsible for the functional demo of our app. Attaining this skill will be difficult since this is our first time using it.
            <b>Figma:</b> Figma is responsible for the overall design and basic layout of our app. It is a web based graphic editor thus picking up this skill shouldn’t be as difficult</p>

            <h3>General Skills</h3>
            <p>The commonly required general skills when working in a team are communication, organisation, management and overall good sense of work ethics and collaboration.</p>
