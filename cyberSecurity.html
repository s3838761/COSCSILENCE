            <h1>Cyber-Security</h1>
            <h2>What does it do?</h2>
            <p>Cyber Security as entailed it pretty much the security and prevention of cyber-attacks and cyber threats. While this is quite a basic definition, CISCO provides a nice explanation when they state, “Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks.” To get a deeper understanding it is important to understand what these digital attacks are and how modern cyber security effectively disarms this threat. Types of cybersecurity threats are as follow; Phishing, ransomware, malware, and social engineering (CISCO, 2019). While these are some main ones, they are not the only ones are there are plenty types of cyber threats. These threats are not only aimed to attack people’s computers and inject virus but also steal data and information from members like credit card information’s which are collected in phishing attacks. It is very important that people take the proper precautions when browsing the web and using a computer of some sorts.</p>
            <p>Cybersecurity doesn’t just focus on the digital side as it also places a focus on physical prevention of cyber-attacks. “Physical security refers to the protection of building sites and equipment”  (National Center of Education Statistics, 2019). Ensuring that building sites and equipment are kept in a secure environment prevents the unwanted people accessing devices that they’re not allowed to. This ensures that no direct injecting of anything lethal is done. This can be done in many ways and summing up what the National Center of Education statistics, 2019 express, ensuring devices are locked properly and frequently and even using anti-theft cables allows for some physical prevention against possible cyber-attacks. Personally, at my work place all the computers that are placed outside of an office are placed near camera’s and to take it a step further you can only enter the premises by showing the security guards your roster. This prevents unauthorized members entering the building and possibly doing anything malicious to our computer network.</p>
            <p>While it may seem like with the boom of technology cyber security has only recently become a major concern it has been around for many years. As stated by Honey well, “Cybersecurity has existed since the creation of the first computer virus in 1971.” While the threat of cyber attacks evolve so does cyber security. Originally cybersecurity focused on preventing attacks from happening but as they got more and more complicated and evolved to counter current measures, cybersecurity changed its focus and started using “on execution protection”(Deep Instinct, 2019). This means that instead of preventing the attack from taking place it would detect the attack while it occurred then shut it down. Most recently we have been using deep learning to not only shut down on going attacks but detect them as well. Deep learning also yields a low false positive detection ratio (Deep Instinct, 2019).</p>
            <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
            <p>Having cybersecurity as an essential part of not only online computing but computing in general ensures that data can be stored securely. However, as threats continue to evolve so does the defenses. While it can be a bit hard to think of what new threats will appear and how we will then defend them Honey Well predicts that “USBs will be a more potent threat”. They suggest this because now a days USBs are found almost everywhere and are easily accessible. On top of this they also found out that “USB threats to industrials more than doubled to 59 percent.” (Honey Well, n.d) This then begs the question how will this be countered? I can only predict that USB covers will become more prominent to physically prevent unwanted devices being entered. On top of this better threat detection software would become readily available providing more accurate threat detections.</p>
            <p>On top of this as the companies incorporate machine learning and AI more and more, they are subjected to be the target of cyber-attacks (Parker, 2020). However, suggested by Parker, AI would also be used to help prevent attacks with the inclusion of “embed AI in user interfaces to warn people about risky websites or poor-quality security choices” (Parker, 2020).</p>
            <p>A final note on this is that as more people are exposed to this growing technology, “There’ll be more hackers to deal with” (Parker, 2020). While there will be more hacking to deal with it also means that more and more cyber security jobs would become available.</p>
            <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
            <p>Cybersecurity is quite an essential part of my daily life. I have anti malware and virus detection software downloaded on my computer (Malwarebytes) and I also tread the waters of the internet with caution. I tend to not download anything from sites I do not know of, or which are not reliable. I also scan all a lot of the files I download to make sure they do not contain any malicious content. Furthermore, I keep my laptop in a casing tucked away to prevent any unwarranted devices being entered. However, I was not always as concerned about cyber threats as I lost an old laptop to various viruses and malware when trying to torrent Minecraft at age14. While at face value this is a negative it prompted me to educate myself and learn about cyber attack prevention to ensure it doesn’t happen again.
                <br>This is pretty much the same for my friends and family. We all have some sort of anti-virus on our computers/devices and are quite cautious on what websites we visit. 
                </p>
            <p>I expect that as we move forward, we will all become more familiar with cyber threat prevention software and allow cybersecurity to become a more essential part of our lives.</p>
