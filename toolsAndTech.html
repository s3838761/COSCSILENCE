            <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
            <p>When it comes to the various tools and technologies, we have utilized it comes down to GitHub, Google Docs, Visual Studio Code, Flutter (includes Android Studio), Figma and various Microsoft Office products like word and excel.
            <br>The main purpose of GitHub in this project was to allow team members to collaboratively work on the website at the same time. As well as this it allowed us to work on our flutter prototype at the same time on the same file, which increased productivity as we didn't have to constantly send files back and forth as it was all hosted in our GitHub repository.
            <br>Similarly, to GitHub, Google Docs was used as a central point where the team can bring together all their work and work on different parts of the report simultaneously.
            </p>
            <p>Like with the previous assignment Visual Studio Code was utilized to develop the website.
            <br>New to this assignment however was the introduction of Flutter which was used in conjunction with Android Studios to produce one of our prototypes. Flutter is an open-source software development kit, so we did not have to purchase any licenses. Since this is also a new technology which we all were unfamiliar with, it meant we needed to learn how to code with Flutter. This was done through the use of YouTube videos and even LinkedIn Learning courses. Since Flutter is open sourced it means we utilized community made assets and features from pub.dev. Here we were able to get a fortune wheel feature which was easily converted into the task selection wheel. Finally, in Android Studios we used the Google Pixel 5 to test and emulate our app.
            <br>On a small note, while we did not have the time to fully implement a database to work without an app, we did take the time to consider what would be most practical in this scenario. We concluded that we would integrate Firebase with our Flutter app as it provides its own database and extra features like Google Sign in. Firebase also easily integrates with Flutter with the help of Pub.dev. We were able to use a free account to see how it worked but in reality, it would be ideal to pay for the subscription which came with its own benefits of better servers, more storage space and more features overall.
            </p>
            <p>Another new tool being used for this assignment was the web based prototyping app Figma. Figma was used to create all the UI of the application with a focus on the navigation and how each element would link to each other. To use Figma and view our prototype only really needed is an up to date browser.</p>
            <p>Overall to use our prototypes a simple laptop should suffice. However, in the future when we fully complete the app it would be ideal to simply download it from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store on your mobile device.</p>
