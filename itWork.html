            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p><b>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</b>
            <br>The kind of work that is done by the IT professional is mainly customer service and troubleshooting with clients. They would deal with incoming tickets, such as software requests and hardware requests, such as provisioning new equipment such as laptops and monitors for people within the company. They would also handle the onboarding process for any new starters and also access requests for business applications. The IT professional would also help out with other side projects, with the current side project having to do with prepping the move to a new office.</p>
            <p><b>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</b>
            <br>All of the clients that the IT professional would interact with would be internal to the company. That means that the only people that they would interact with are either internal stakeholders or other staff members within the company. Some of the staff that they would work with are the HR team and the talent acquisition team. Working closely with those teams as they would handle the equipment for all new staff, sending in laptops, monitors, keyboards, mice, and being ready for them once they come into the office. They would also interact with other IT professionals within their own team, with the majority of the time working closely with the team, allocating roles to each member and helping each other out. The IT professional would also work with other teams, such as the security team, and the other tech teams within the company.</p>
            <p><b>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</b>
            <br>The most time consuming part of the IT professional’s job is dealing with helpdesk tickets which come in the form of access requests and hardware requests. As they work in a large company with about 15000 employees within the company they would have to deal with a lot of tickets on a daily basis dealing with requests to access both different programs and hardwares.</p>
            <p><b>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</b>
            <br>The most challenging part of their position is dealing with the hardware requests from the helpdesk tickets. During the lockdown it would be even harder to deal with troubleshooting with users that aren't tech savvy as you are a lot more limited in the ways that you can influence someone else's machine remotely. Also due to the company being an old company, there is a lot of tech debt that has to be dealt with at different times and is difficult to work through. Another challenging part of troubleshooting is the communication skills needed to get the client to give the answer that is needed or to ask the right questions in order to help them.</p>

            <h1>Interview Transcript</h1>
            <p><b>Richard:</b> Hi, could you please introduce yourself?
                <br><b>Jack:</b> My name is Jack, I do IT support at a financial technology company. I've been working in the IT industry for a while now, and I came in from doing customer support previously and have moved into IT from there.</p>
            <p><b>Richard:</b> So does that mean that you have a lot of interactions with both other IT professionals and clients?
                <br><b>Jack:</b> Yes correct, our clients are all internal, that i deal with anyway, so only internal stakeholders or internal staff that we deal with, but I also do deal with other IT professionals in my own team and in the teams around me. which includes our security team to make sure that all new applications are taken care of in terms of security procedures making sure that there is nothing to leak our sensitive data, and other higher up tech teams that help with automation pieces within the company</p>
            <p><b>Richard:</b> Are those all the different types of people you interact with?
                <br><b>Jack:</b> We also work hand in hand with our HR team and our talent acquisition team. As we do onboarding for all new starters, we work closely with them to make sure that we are ready for them when they come into the office or to make sure that we are sending out the correct gear for any new starters; laptops, monitors, keyboards, mice, things like that.</p>
            <p><b>Richard:</b> It sounds like a lot of your work is to do with helping other people, but is there any other type of work that you do?
                <br><b>Jack:</b> Currently we are actually moving offices, right now we are going through e-waste so we are throwing out any old laptops, or technologies that we have around including any old cables that have been there from the start, helping with the clean up of that and basically prepping everything for the move, so i am involved in that for the most part and that is our main side project right now.</p>
            <p><b>Richard:</b> What aspects of your work do you spend the most time on?
                <br><b>Jack:</b> The thing that we spend the most time on at the moment is primarily our tickets, just standard helpdesk tickets that come in terms of the access requests and the hardware requests. They probably take up most of our time because our company is quite big with about 15000 people within the company, so we have to deal with a lot of incoming requests for either access to programs or hardware</p>
            <p><b>Richard:</b> Would you say that it is also the most challenging aspect of your work?
                <br><b>Jack:</b> Yeah, I would say probably that the hardware side of things is the most challenging, especially working remotely. It’s quite hard to troubleshoot with users that aren't tech savvy when you're doing it remotely because there are only a certain amount of things that you can do when doing remote control over someone's machine. It would definitely be the most challenging, especially because the company has been around for a while, we have a lot of tech debt that we have to deal with, which comes up at different times which we are working through, but it is a little higher up in scope than what my role currently deals with.</p>
            <p><b>Jack:</b> From an IT side of things there is a lot of stuff to learn. I guess it differs from company to company but my company has had a lot of things change very quickly even just in the few months i've been in my current company we’ve gone through process changes every week, so that's also fun but challenging so if you miss a single meeting you would be on the backfoot. Depending on your team you would have a lot of flexibility to learn, even outside of meetings or training sessions. My team is very helpful like that so i have been very in that aspect of my current job</p>
            <p><b>Richard:</b> So when you work, would you work with your time all the time or only sometimes
                <br><b>Jack:</b> I would say a majority of the time I would work with my team. We use Slack as our messaging application and we essentially have channels for our team and we work closely there. We all grab tickets or be given tickets depending on who's given what for the day and we essentially go through and give people what they are unfamiliar with on purpose so that they are forced to ask questions and learn themselves rather than a single person taking all the hard tickets. It's best to have the whole team upscaled rather than having one person specialised in each thing. Obviously it's good to have subject matter experts on different things but its not worthwhile if say they got sick for a week you can't do a business reticle task</p>
            <p><b>Richard:</b> So it's important to allocate roles when you work?
                <br><b>Jack:</b> correct, everyone with different backgrounds in terms of work career, so people would have experience in certain things. It's always good to make use of the experience and not just treat everyone like they are the same type of mold. For instance in my company we have people who are very up to date with automation in terms of windows machines so they are working in those types of projects, we have some people who have some sort of audiovisual experience from previous jobs so they are working on the move to the new office. Its always good to make sure that you are using your people in the right way, but it is also important to spread the knowledge around to make sure that if there was anything that happened to anyone you wouldn't be falling apart.</p>
            <p><b>Ben:</b> I’ve just got a quick question. In terms of your IT skills, what would you say you would rely on the most, and what non-IT skills help you out on a day to day basis in your job.
                <br><b>Jack:</b> From an IT skill side of things, the biggest thing to know is to know your way around your computer and how to use google. If someone has figured it out already there is no point spending the time trying to slog through it, if they have a well written answer you might as well use it.
                <b>Richard:</b> Like wikihow?
                <br><b>Jack:</b> Exactly, Wikihow, Yahoo answers if it still existed, Stackexchange is really good aswell for finding more technical things. But honestly even just the basic level of knowing how to navigate the internet really helps in a role like this, because a lot of stuff has been seen before and alot of stuff has been used across companies across the world so there is always someone who has or at least 90% of the time has seen what you are experiencing and has logged it somewhere. From an IT side of things it would just be knowing your way around that is a huge plus.
                In terms of Non-IT skills, the customer service part of my previous career has been a huge plus, because if you know how to talk with clients, you would be able to resolve issues way faster. If people are more willing to give you the information or you know how to ask the right questions you can resolve the issues much faster than if you were just running into a brick wall and not really getting information out of them because you are being rude by accident or what have you there.</p>
            <p><b>Ben:</b> So i see the correlation between asking the right question to clients and the right questions on google to get the right answer needed
                <br><b>Jack:</b> Exactly, having the kind of open mind to be able to find the correct question to ask because there are no dumb questions for the most part. Being able to find the question that you need to ask to get the correct information is 90% of the battle in IT, if you don't know how to ask the question they can't give you the information</p>
            <p><b>Ben:</b> To wrap it up, would you recommend your job?
                <br><b>Jack:</b> Yes I would recommend my job, it is a great industry to get into, especially now in the time of technology growing, with different startups popping up around the place. If you can get into a startup that is growing you generally have a good foot in the door to continue your career. Another good thing with It is that once you get your foot in the door IT is transferable anywhere. If you know how to build a computer, you can build a computer for most companies, if you know how to plug in a monitor you are 50% of the way there. It is a good career path to get into purely because you can pivot into other things from there, you can even move into things like business analyst roles once you get experience in a company, purely because you pick up so much passive knowledge just from being at the job that you can just move along companies as long as they allow it.</p>
