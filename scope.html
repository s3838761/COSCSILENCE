            <h1>Scopes and Limits</h1>
            <h2>Scopes</h2>
            <p>The three main features of the application we are currently aiming to achieve and demonstrate are: </p>  
            <ul class="circle">
                <li><p><strong>Assigning tasks and the correlated rewards: (authenticator’s perspective)</strong><br>This feature will enable the authenticators to assign certain tasks for the users, and once assigned, the tasks will be available in various formats for the users to choose from. For example a chore wheel, a to do list, game levels/platforms, or even fun and creative variations of existing formats such as a bingo or lottery machine containing the assigned tasks, but for the sake of simplicity and feasibility, we will mainly focus our attention on developing the chore wheel/bar. </p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Selecting and checking off the tasks: (user’s perspective)</strong>
                    Another essential feature that is a bare minimum requirement for the functionality of the app is allowing users to receive the assigned tasks attached with all its information regarding the content of the task itself, what kinds of reward can be expected and how much it’s worth (based on the in-game currency) in a desired format. Checking an item off the list should be designed and developed in such a way that it’s a reward in itself as this promotes dopamine secretion which is connected to our sensations of pleasure, learning and motivation, thus can increase overall productivity.
                    </p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Exchanging the accumulated reward currency for other rewards</strong>
                    The third feature is somewhat intertwined with the other two as it provides the authenticators with the ability to assign a price/worth to an existing task, which the users then can either claim the ‘instant’ reward or claim the assigned in-game currency (tickets). The currency can accumulate overtime if the user wishes to save it rather than impulsive spending or going for the instant reward, this helps to add some elements of gamification and reinforce the beneficial habit of saving and smart spending.
                    </p></li>
            </ul>        
            <p>These features will be demonstrated through a combination of aesthetic (figma) and functional (flutter) artifacts. </p>
            <h2>Limits</h2>
            <p>The most obvious limitation we have to deal with is the constraints of time, this especially applies even more for our group considering that our project requires us to learn and familiarise ourselves with a completely new set of programming language, which can be quite an ordeal because none of our team members have any preceding knowledge or experience with Dart or Flutter, furthermore, it’s source of contents for learning and debugging is more limited compared to the likes of its competitors (Javascript and C#) due to the vast difference in maturity. This setback can severely delay the project in its entirety as the overall progression is heavily dependent on the production of tangible artifacts and if necessary, actions aren’t taken, poor quality work and results are to be expected. The only way past this obstacle is to deal with it head-on, this could be done by better managing our schedule so that we have sufficient time dedicated to ensuring that we have a solid grasp of the software before employing it. </p>
