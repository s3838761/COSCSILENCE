            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>The IT industry can be quite diverse from a career perspective as it branches out to many distinct and specialized fields, this trend of diversity can be observed via our team’s ideal jobs. There’s a plethora of similar and different aspects of our chosen career titles, for instance, when looking at our group’s ideal jobs, a majority of members are all IT related, the only exception is David with his being more catered to the field of analytical business, however that doesn’t mean David won’t need or use any of his set of IT related skills. Meanwhile the rest of the team’s areas of interest include cybersecurity (Budoor), programmer/developer (Dat and Benjamin) and IT administration (Richard). The required general and IT-related skills for our ideal jobs correlate with one another despite us having various job titles with different responsibilities and requirements. This is obviously due to the nature of the field of work that encompasses most if not all of team-member’s jobs, as one set of skills can often be applied differently to certain scenarios. An example of this is the fact that both Benjamin and I (Dat) are required to have experience and be efficient with JAVA even though our careers are branched off.</p>
            <h3>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h3>
            <p><b>Ben:</b> My opinions on my ideal haven't changed. The main reason for this is because I was already confident and knew what a job in Frontend Development entailed. If anything Seeing the data has made me realise that I should also focus and develop some other skills that I might have neglected. For one, SQL seems like something I should familiarize myself more with and get a much deeper understanding on. As well as this building some better organization skills and planning skills would be favorable as I believe I lack in those skills at the moment and they appear to be sought after skills. Overall my opinion on my ideal job hasn't changed but understanding key skills employers look for has.</p>
            <p><b>Richard:</b> After looking at the Burning Glass data my opinion of my ideal job has not changed. This is because I already knew that both SQL and Microsoft office skills were needed for the job. While my ideal job hasn't changed, I have realized that communication skills are the most in demand and I should focus on building my own communication skills.</p>
            <p><b>Dat:</b> After having looked and analysed the Burning Glass data, my opinion for my ideal job remains the same as I am awfully intrigued by the very concept of virtual/augmented reality and how these types of technology can be applied to various fields of work. Although employers’ demands for VR/AR specific job titles and skills are considerably below average when compared to other mainstream IT positions, I still strongly believe that there are plenty more advancements we have yet to make seeing that VR/AR is still somewhat considered a fairly new technology hence demands and needs for it will also increase overtime.</p>
            <p><b>David:</b> Observing the burning glass data simply outlines the skills required for certain roles if I were to pursue certain jobs. My ideal job as a salesforce technical consultant and the software skills required varies depending on each company. I would only invest time and learn a specific program and software if the said job requires so.</p>
            <p><b>Budoor:</b> In fact, it was an interesting data to look at; however, my opinion of my ideal job has not changed because I mainly choose this job based on my personal passion for data protection and security. Moreover, the burning glass data illustrates that IT security jobs are well-paid which is another great reason to not changing my ideal job. However, it became clear to me from the burning glass data that I should learn several technical skills such as SQL and Java.  In addition, I should learn and gain some of the important general skills such as problem solving, effective communication and time management.</p>
