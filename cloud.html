            <h1>Clouds, Services, Servers</h1>
            <img src="assests/cloudImage.png" alt="Cloud connection to various tech" width="50%">
            <h2>What does it do?</h2>
            <p>Cloud services and servers are slowly becoming an essential part of the internet and computing in general. A very simplistic way of viewing it would be a means for companies or individuals to access equipment in a remote location to complete a task or just store something. However, taking a deeper dive into it, we can clearly see that it gets much more complicated than that. For one the broad subject of cloud computing itself can be broken down into 3 main categories all with their pros and cons. These being public clouds, private clouds, and hybrid clouds.</p>
            <h3>Public Clouds</h3>
            <p>Summed up by Red Hat, Inc, “All clouds become public clouds when the environments are partitioned and redistributed to multiple tenants.” This basically means that if a cloud system is available to multiple customers, then it is considered a public cloud. The most notable in this category are Apple's iCloud, Google Drive and Dropbox, however it isn’t limited to data storage as services like Zoom and Netflix. A major pro to having data and content stored on a public cloud is that it is flexible and able to accommodate large usage spikes and allows for more customers (Business News Daily, 2020).</p>
            <h3>Private Clouds</h3>
            <p>Private Clouds provide the same functionality but according to Red Hat, Inc, they are only used by one customer. So instead of being used by multiple organisations a private cloud is build and used by one company/customer. The benefits of a private cloud system are that it offers “both security and control” (Felter, 2019). This is because the system is being accessed by one customer there isn’t really the possibility for a data breach on top of this, the fact that it is only held and used by one customer is also a slight draw back as it could also mean that it might not be able to keep up especially with a big organisation. This is highlighted with Linus Tech Tips own private cloud server which stores a giant amount of video files, and he is constantly upgrading his existing server providing more and more storage.</p>
            <h3>Hybrid Clouds</h3>
            <p>A hybrid cloud as entailed by the name is a hybrid of both a public cloud system and a private cloud system. It takes advantage of both systems to provide a unique personalised but also flexible experience for its customers and users.
                <br>The biggest pro about a hybrid cloud system is the connectivity of multiple cloud systems. Whether it be a private with a public or multiple public and so on. Having multiple clouds working together allows for a more fluid workflow.</p>
            <h3>The Future of the cloud</h3>
            <p>Cloud systems and services have a giant amount of potential within the near future. Whether that be with corporations moving to a fully cloud system workplace or the possibility of VR turning towards cloud services like Google Stadia to provide a technology which is easier to buy into an access. It is predicted that by 2025 around “80% of organisations” will migrate towards cloud, hosting, and colocation services” (Galov, 2019). The main benefit organisations would see is a less amount of money spent on computer hardware and possibly licensing fees as they computers required to run hardware intensive software would not need the expensive and hard to find graphics cards we have now.</p>
            <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
            <p>As stated previously the biggest impact would be the amount of money that would be saved. Instead of purchasing and devoting a large amount of money for on site hardware, organisations would save plenty of money by just investing in a fraction of the cost with a recurring payment.</p>
            <p>I believe people that would take full advantage of this would be students. Having the ability to access licensed software for either free when provided by their educational provider or by paying a small recurring fee would save them the cost of purchasing the license and even the expensive hardware to run it. As well as students, engineers and other members who use a lot of CAD software would take full advantage of this by allowing them to design on the go and share their work with their clients quite rapidly. For instance, a client could be based in the USA while the designer is on sight in a foreign country where they don’t have access to a setup which would handle, they’re design software, given that they use a cloud service they could easily do what they would normally do on a laptop a fraction of the cost of their professional setup.</p>
            <p>On the other hand with gaming Cloud services becoming a more predominant occurrence, I wouldn’t put it past the merge of cloud and VR gaming occurring with more affordable VR headsets for not only gaming but even consumers.</p>
            <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
            <p>In my day-to-day life I find myself using cloud services more. It seems like every aspect of my life uses some sort of cloud-based service or server in some shape or form. For instance, I work for Woolworths Online Factory and on a day-to-day basis I am accessing data from a cloud-based database which I use to then check customer demands and orders for that day and then I would update that. Furthermore, RMIT uses many cloud services. One example of this is the myDesktop service. This allows RMIT students and staff to access programs being run on a system/computer other than your own. This comes in handy during covid times especially when some of my friends who don’t have computers to run auto cad software, they are easily able to use myDesktop which uses the hardware of another computer and pretty much streams it directly to you.</p>
            <p>In terms of family, I see my older relatives just discovering and getting the hand of it. My grandfather recently got an iPhone and finds the ability to store photos and videos on the cloud a great way for him to free up space. On the other hand, my younger cousins are growing up into a world which is run by the cloud, and they constantly access public cloud services like Netflix, Zoom and most recently have even been getting into cloud-based gaming with a Google Stadia.</p>
            <p>Overall cloud computing has become an essential staple point of modern-day technology and computing</p>
