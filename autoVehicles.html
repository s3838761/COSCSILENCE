            <h1>Autonomous Vehicles</h1>
            <h2>What does it do?</h2>
            <p>The autonomous vehicle is an automobile that can operate without the intervention of a human being. These systems are fully capable of running without direct human supervision in a safe and successful manner. To operate, they make use of “sensors, actuators, complex algorithms, machine learning systems, and processors” to sense their surroundings. These sensors are mounted on specific areas of the vehicle to create an ongoing map of the vehicle's surroundings. In addition to monitoring the position of nearby vehicles, they monitor traffic lights, road signs and pedestrians. Using radar technology, automobiles can locate nearby vehicles and calculate their speeds and directions. Thus far, the most prominent technology in the public market is radar cruise control which maintains a distance from cars in front of the vehicle with no regard for speed. Light detection sensors, or Lidar, use pulses of light to measure distance, identify road edges, and determine lane markings. Despite its similar purpose and operation, this application is more expensive than similar sensors. In addition, Lidar often struggles to be accurate under unfavourable conditions such as rain, snow, and fog.</p>
            <p>In current technology, autonomous vehicles face significant hurdles and become publicly optional. So self-driving is currently an option. In this scenario, the vehicle can operate to a certain extent depending on its environment, but a human must remain present or be ready to take over in order to drive.</p>
            <p>A multitude of reasons account for autonomous vehicles' absence from the public road system. There is still a lot of work to be done in the technology field. A significant obstacle to an accurate environment identification is weather and traffic conditions that impose challenges to the vehicles' sensors. Among these situations are heavy rain, chaotic traffic jams and poor visibility of road signs due to natural and human interference.</p>
            <p>Machine learning uses software and algorithms that process data that comes from its sensors to accurately conclude a safe decision. However, the market has not come to an agreement with suitable algorithms that are accurately tested in all environments. Further research and development are to be applied in order to make autonomous vehicles safe and available for public use.</p>
            <p>The use of machine learning in autonomous vehicles is also a significant factor that uses software and algorithms to accurately analyse data collected from the vehicle’s sensors. There is still a lack of suitable algorithms that are tested in a wide variety of environments, so further research and development are required by the market to bring autonomous vehicles to the public.</p>
            <p>In addition, the inaccurate sensors, machine learning that isn’t up to par, and celebrities involved in accidents with automated vehicles, such as TESLA, heavily affect social acceptance and are many reasons as to why autonomous vehicles are currently not on the open road.</p>
            <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
            <p>Having a fully functional, regulated autonomous vehicle on the open road could have a substantial impact on several aspects for the market. For instance, the safety of travelling on the road will be heightened since human errors will be eradicated, which are the main causes for motor vehicle accidents. As a result of fewer car accidents there are also fewer health-related issues and repair costs. Vehicles being able to communicate with one another, hence, traffic efficiency would be enhanced, and traffic jams avoided, thereby significantly improving social wellbeing and morale.</p>
            <p>There are winners and losers in the autonomous vehicle space; those who do not drive have easier access to transportation thanks to autonomous vehicles. Automated delivery vehicles can be employed by businesses. As a result, employees employed by ride-sharing services, trucks, and food delivery businesses have been reduced to nothing and replaced by autonomous vehicles.</p>
            <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
            <p>The daily commute to work will be shortened in the immediate future due to shorter travel times. However, in the current job environment, jobs are becoming hybrid work-from-home, and the use of autonomous transportation will have only a minor impact. Contrary to popular belief, car enthusiasts will not find the autonomous vehicle market to their liking and will most certainly continue to use their own vehicles. Nevertheless, these individuals can opt to use the autonomous vehicles for work-related purposes only and keep their personal cars shiny with low odometer readings.</p>
            <p>Extracurricular activities will be looked upon. Individuals can now consume alcohol and substances without worrying about safely returning home after the experience, eliminating the need for a designated driver. Visiting grocery stores and visiting family members have never been easier or safer for elderly relatives.</p>
