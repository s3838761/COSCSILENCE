            <h1>Risks</h1>
            <p>There are a few possible risks facing the development of our project seeing that some of the software’s (including languages) we’ve chosen are new, unfamiliar, considered somewhat unpopular and aren’t mainstream in the community.</p>
            <p>Flutter, our main choice for the functional development of the application, is a fairly new type of open-source software development kit (SDK) created and launched by Google back in late 2018, it’s featuring programming language is Dart which is also rather quite new in the scheme of other languages. This means that it’ll most likely be more difficult to debug and troubleshoot the program as both the SDK and it’s inclusive language haven’t been around long enough to have a sufficient amount of resources for referencing.</p>
            <p>Another possible risk relating to the implementation of software’s is that the learning curve for Dart can be quite steep due to its low popularity of usage, not also mentioning our limitation for time and resource. Furthermore, it’s also still in the development phases which means that we may run into the risk of having our codes incorrectly documented if we were to develop using Dart before it’s stable release or update. Because of its volatile nature, there isn’t a significant demand for that specific skillset as of now, but that may or may not change in the future as Dart and its utilisation in Flutter is steadily rising in popularity. </p>
            <p>Aside from generic risks and the risks associated with software’s, there shouldn’t be any other notable roadblocks that we can consider as on the hardware side of things, all team members have access to equipment and tools that are adequately more than capable for handling and completing the required tasks. </p>
            <h1>Group processes and communications</h1>
            <p>Our group's main source of communication is through the use of Microsoft Teams. Teams are being used as it is a great place to openly discuss any issues we might have or start a small thread on an inquiry we might have. Furthermore, it allows us to host 2 meetings a week. The first meeting we have a week is on Mondays at around 6:30pm. We have this meeting to set the mood for the week and set small achievable goals and targets that we wish to have completed sometime that week. Following on from that, our second meeting is Thursdays at around 1:30pm. The main purpose of this meeting is to check in with progress and openly discuss any roadblocks and hurdles we might be facing. This then would lead to us asking valuable questions to Anthony and thus providing further clarification. In this meeting we also discuss individual progress and make sure that everyone knows what they need to do and are on top of it. Outside of meetings we made an effort to communicate more frequently in the text chats ensuring that everyone is on the same page and knows what has or hasn't been completed. Another feature of Microsoft Teams that we used was an addon which allowed us to assign certain members to a task. It also allowed us to leave comments in regard to progression and mark tasks as urgent and complete.</p>
